        <h2>Bodybuilding Basics</h2>
        <p>Bodybuilding differs from powerlifting or Olympic lifting in that it’s judged on a competitor’s physical
            appearance rather than physical strength.
            As such, bodybuilders aspire to develop and maintain a well-balanced, lean and muscular physique.
            To do this, many bodybuilders start with an off-season followed by an in-season way of eating — referred to
            as a bulking and cutting phase, respectively.
            During the bulking phase, which can last months to years, bodybuilders eat a high-calorie, protein-rich diet
            and lift weights intensely with the goal of building as much muscle as possible (1Trusted Source).
            The following cutting phase focuses on losing as much fat as possible while maintaining muscle mass
            developed during the bulking phase. This is achieved through specific changes in diet and exercise over a
            period of 12–26 weeks (1Trusted Source).

                <p class="card-text">Bodybuilding training and dieting is typically divided into two phases: bulking and
                    cutting. The goal of the bulking phase is to build muscle, whereas the cutting phase is dedicated to
                    preserving muscle while losing body fat.</p>

        <h2>Benifits of Bodybuilding</h2>
        <p>There are several health benefits associated with bodybuilding.</p>
        <p>In order to maintain and build muscles, bodybuilders exercise frequently, performing both resistance and
            aerobic training.</p>
        <p>Resistance training increases muscle strength and size. Muscle strength is highly correlated with a lower
            risk of dying from cancer, heart and kidney disease, as well as several other critical illnesses (2Trusted
            Source).</p>
        <p>Aerobic exercise, which bodybuilders regularly implement to reduce body fat, improves heart health and
            significantly lowers your risk of developing or dying from heart disease — the number one killer in America
            (3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source). </p>
        <p>In addition to exercise, bodybuilders also focus on their nutrition</p>
        <p>With careful planning, bodybuilders can eat in a way that not only supports their efforts in the gym but
            keeps them healthy too. </p>
        <p>Following a healthy eating pattern, including nutrient-dense foods from all food groups in appropriate
            amounts, can significantly lower your risk of chronic diseases (5Trusted Source).</p>

                <h5 class="card-title" style="color: orangered;">Summary</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Bodybuilders exercise regularly and may eat well-planned and nutrient-dense diets,
                    both of which offer many health benefits.</p>

        <h2>Bodybuilding Supplements</h2>
        <p>The best bodybuilding supplements include:</p>
        <div></div>
        <p>
            <li><span> Whey Protien:</span>Consuming whey protein powder is an easy and convenient way to increase your
                protein intake. </li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li><span> Creatine:</span> Creatine provides your muscles with the energy needed to perform an additional
                rep or two. While there are many brands of creatine, look for creatine monohydrate as it’s the most
                effective (12Trusted Source).</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li><span> Caffein:</span> Caffeine decreases fatigue and allows you to work harder. It’s found in
                pre-workout supplements, coffee or tea (13Trusted Source).</li>
        </p>
        <p>A multi-vitamin and mineral supplement may be helpful if you’re limiting your calorie intake in an effort to
            reduce body fat during your cutting phase.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title" style="color: orangered;">Summary</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Include a variety of nutrient-rich foods across and within all the food groups in
                    your diet. Avoid or limit alcohol, foods with added sugars and deep-fried foods. In addition to your
                    diet, whey protein, creatine and caffeine can be useful supplements.</p>
